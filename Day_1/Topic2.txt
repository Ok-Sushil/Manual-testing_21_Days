Subtopic c: Best Practices for Writing Test Cases
===========================================================================
✔ Use Clear & Simple Language – Avoid ambiguity.
✔ Be Specific – Mention exact input data & expected output.
✔ Use Consistent Formatting – Follow a structured format.
✔ Cover Positive & Negative Scenarios – Test all possibilities.
✔ Make Tests Reproducible – Anyone should be able to follow them.
✔ Keep Tests Independent – Avoid dependencies between test cases.

📌 Example of a Poor Test Case:
❌ Test login functionality. (Too vague)

✅ Example of a Good Test Case:
✔ Verify login with valid credentials, ensuring the user is redirected to the homepage.

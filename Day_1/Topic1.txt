Topic 1: Basics of Manual Testing & SDLC/STLC
Subtopic a: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) â€“ Stages & Importance
=================================================================================
ðŸ”¹ What is SDLC?
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is the process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software.

ðŸ”¹ Stages of SDLC:

Phase                            	Description
1. Requirement Analysis	            Understanding what the software should do.
2. Planning	                        Deciding timeline, budget, and resources.
3. Design	                        Creating system architecture & UI/UX design.
4. Development	                    Coding and building the software.
5. Testing	                        Checking if the software works as expected.
6. Deployment	                    Releasing software for end users.
7. Maintenance	                    Fixing bugs and updating features.

ðŸ“Œ Why is SDLC important?
âœ” Ensures structured software development
âœ” Reduces risks & errors
âœ” Saves time & cost

Subtopic b: Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) â€“ Test Planning, Execution & Reporting
========================================================================================================
ðŸ”¹ What is STLC?
STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) is a step-by-step process for testing software.

ðŸ”¹ Stages of STLC:
Phase	Description
1. Requirement Analysis	                               Understanding the test requirements.
2. Test Planning	                                   Deciding test strategy, tools, and resources.
3. Test Case Development	                           Writing test cases based on requirements.
4. Environment Setup	                               Setting up the test environment.
5. Test Execution	                                   Running test cases and reporting defects.
6. Test Closure	                                       Reviewing test reports and lessons learned.


ðŸ“Œ Why is STLC important?
âœ” Helps in systematic testing
âœ” Ensures all functionalities are covered
âœ” Reduces defects in production

Subtopic c: Manual Testerâ€™s Role â€“ Responsibilities & Skills
======================================================================================================
ðŸ”¹ What does a Manual Tester do?
âœ” Understands requirements & test scenarios.
âœ” Creates test cases & test data.
âœ” Executes manual test cases.
âœ” Logs defects & issues in bug tracking tools (JIRA, Bugzilla).
âœ” Verifies fixes & performs regression testing.

ðŸ”¹ Skills Required:
âœ” Analytical skills â€“ Understanding complex workflows.
âœ” Attention to detail â€“ Catching even minor issues.
âœ” Communication skills â€“ Reporting bugs effectively.
âœ” Basic SQL knowledge â€“ Verifying data in databases.
âœ” Basic automation knowledge â€“ For future growth.
